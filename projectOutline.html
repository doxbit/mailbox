		When examining how we interact with the internet, we generally view it as an active choice. The user goes to the website. They initiate the interaction. But in a world of constant connectivity and endless notifications, we no longer choose to go to the internet, the internet actively comes to us. Mailbox is designed to remove all these hooks that internet services have - you go to it, it doesn’t come to you.
<br> <br>
Mailbox is a messaging service designed around physical ‘Mailbox’ locations, which you must visit in order to send and receive mail. It brings the metaphor of physical letters into the digital space. This forces the user to engage with their messages in a more considered way. Furthermore it ensures that the user only receives messages at their own pace. If you go home for the evening, you can no longer be sent more messages, as you no longer have access to a mailbox. Most modern messaging platforms demand the users attention through notification, and hence create an expectation of a response. There is no such expectations if the sender knows that the recipient does not directly receive the message.


<h3 class="bodyhead">User Profiles</h3>
<p>
	Mailbox is aimed at those who want a low pressure messaging platform which they can engage with at their own pace.

	<br><br>One possible use case could be a workplace which doesn’t work correspondence chasing employees home. It would require the user to tag their phone at a work Mailbox to catch up on what people have sent them. There is no pressure to read the work messages before they can, as they are simply inaccessible outside the office.

	<br><br>However there is no need to restrict this platform to specific use cases. Mailboxes could easily be deployed in public spaces where any user could utilise them for any messaging purpose.
