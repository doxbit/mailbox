Visually the overall design and feel of the app is reminiscent of a DOS interface. This felt like a visual space where simplicity and clarity could thrive. The simple black and white interface, with simple clear fonts is designed to stay out of the way, allowing the user to focus on the message. To further simplify the visual feel of the piece, capitalisation is not used in any of the interface elements (although the user is not restricted from using capitals in their own messages).
