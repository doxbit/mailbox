<h3 class="bodyhead">Dead Drops</h3>
	<p>
	This was a great first touchstone for this project, as a physical place where individuals could connect. However, while it could have been used to communicate directly (for example leaving .txt files on the usb drive), it is not intentionally designed for personal interaction. Metaphorically it is much closer to a noticeboard than a letterbox. Mailbox is a project designed for direct messaging, just broken into discrete longer form messages.</p>

<h3 class="bodyhead">Slowly</h3>
	<p>
This pen pal app is the best example of a stand alone mobile product design to embrace slow messaging. It is based around the idea that the further away a recipient is, the longer the message takes to be delivered. This simple gimmick forces the user to spend more time considering each message before pressing send. This weight that it places on each message is something I hope to create in Mailbox. While there is no artificial message delay, the requirement of visiting a physical Mailbox would introduce some delay and gravity to each message.	</p>

<h3 class="bodyhead">Chestnote</h3>
	<p>
Chestnote is a primary example of a geofenced messaging. The brand is now focusing on developing their API for others to use in their platform (as opposed to running their own consumer facing app). They allow messages to be delivered when they reach a certain place, or time, or weather (or really any other contextual data). They are however not centered around specific locations, which demands a physical interaction like Mailbox. Mailbox is designed to connect people and their messages with a physical spot, but through an active interaction. It is designed to be closer to placing a letter in a mailbox, rather than just having a message appear on your phone when you reach a certain place.	</p>
