There are two parts to the Mailbox experience - the app, and the 'Mailbox', in the form of a NFC sticker. The app functions as the user input, as well as where the user can view messages. They can write messages wherever they would like, as you would a letter, but can only send them from a Mailbox. The Mailbox is also where the user can access the received messages. Only through scanning the sticker with the app can the user use the true messaging functionality. After scanning the app will lock itself again after 20 minutes, or once the user leaves the vicinity of the Mailbox.
